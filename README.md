# This is a standalone proof compress & batch tool for zkWASM guest and host circuits.

## Motivation

Delphinus-zkWASM supports a restricted continuation protocol by providing the context read(write) host APIs so that the execution of a large trace can be splitted into multiple code traces and the following trace can access the previous stack and memory. The whole process works similar to a context store/restore in a standard operation system.

The basic idea is to put context in a specific column so that in the proof the commitment of that column is stored in the proof transcript. When the batcher batchs a continuation flow of proofs, it checks that the input context commitment is equal to the output context commitment of the previous context.

# Pipeline

1. Describe circuits:
2. Generate the witnesses of circuits
3. Generate the proofs from the witnesses of various circuits
4. Define your batching policy via the batch DSL. 
5. Execute the batching DSL and generate the batching circuit
6. Generate the final solidity for your batching circuit
  

## Description of a withness input
```
{
  "circuit": "xxx.circuit.data",
  "k": 21,
  "instance_size": [
    9
  ],
  "transcripts": [
    "xxx.0.transcript.data"
  ],
  "instances": [
    "xxx.0.instance.data"
  ],
  "witnesses": [
    "xxx.0.witness.data"
  ],
  "param": "K21.params",
  "name": "xxx_name",
  "hashtype": "Poseidon"
}
```


## Description proof for a specific target through ProofLoadInfo

```
{
  "circuit": "test.circuit.data",
  "instance_size": [
    1
  ],
  "transcripts": [
    "test.0.transcript.data"
  ],
  "instances": [
    "test.0.instance.data"
  ],
  "hashtype": "Poseidon",
  "param": "K8.params",
  "name": "test"
}

```

## General Command Usage

The general usage is as follows:

```
cargo run --release -- --output [OUTPUT_DIR] [SUBCOMMAND] --[ARGS]
```

where `[SUBCOMMAND]` is the command to execute, and `[ARGS]` are the args specific to that command.

The `--output` arg specifies the directory to write all the output files to and is required for all commands.

## Generate batch proof from ProofLoadInfos

```
cargo run --release -- --output ./sample batch --challenge poseidon -k 21 --info sample/test.loadinfo.json --name batchsample --commits output/commits.json
```

## Verify batch proof from ProofLoadInfos

```
cargo run --release -- --output ./sample verify --challenge poseidon --info sample/batchsample.loadinfo.json
```

## Generate proof from witness
cargo run --release -- --output output prove --info output/aggregator.witnessinfo.json

## integrate with just

1. install just: cargo install just
2. configure your batch in a just script: see sample/batchscript.just
3. just -f sample/batchscript.just
